The displacement of the oscillating spring can be described by
	x = Acos(ωt)
	where
	x = displacement at time t
	A = maximum displacement
	ω = angular frequency, which depends on the spring constant and the mass attached to the spring.
	T = time.
	Find the displacement x for times from 0 to 10 seconds when the maximum displacement.
	A is 4 cm, and the angular frequency is 0.6 rad/sec.
	The results are presented in the displacement and time values table.
