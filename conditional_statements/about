Created a program that prompts the user to enter a scalar value for the outside air temperature.
If the temperature is equal to or above 30oC, a message is sent to the command window telling the user to wear shorts. 
If the temperature is between 18oC and 30oC, a message is sent to the command window telling the user that it is a beautiful day.
If the temperature is equal to or below 18oC, a message is sent to the command window telling the user to wear a jacket or coat. 
The program was tested for several temperature inputs.
