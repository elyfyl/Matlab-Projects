Created x and y vectors from −5 to 5 with a spacing of 0.5. Considered the function z = sin(sqrt(x2 + y2))

(a) The mesh plot function was used to generate a three-dimensional z-graph.
(b) The surf plot function was used to generate a three-dimensional z-graph.
(c) The surface plot was replaced with interpolated shading using different color maps.
(d) Created a contour plot of z. Handle graphics and the clabel function were used to label the contour lines.
(e) Generated a combination surface and contour plot of z.
(f) 5 different plots were created. To show them in a single way, the subplot function was used.
